# Computer Vision
**What is Computer Vision ?** When **Computer Graphics** aims at generating images from a 3D model, **Computer Vision** is the inverse problem and aims at generating 3D model from images. Thus, given images we need to compute **3D model**

## Assignments
* **Assignment 1**: In this assignment, we are going to exercise and get familiar with the basic elements of **projective geometry**. We are going to study the representations of points, lines and planes, as well as transformations and camera matrices.

* **Assignment 2**: In this assignment we will study **camera calibration** and the **DLT method**. We will solve the **resection and
triangulation** problems using DLT and compute inner parameters using **RQ factorization**. In addition, we try out SIFT for feature detection/matching.

* **Assignment 3**: In this assignment we study **epipolar geometry**. we will use the **Fundamental matrix** and the **Essential matrix** for simultaneously reconstructing the structure and the camera motion from two images. 

* **Assignment 4**: In this assignment we will study **model fitting**. In particular we will use **random sampling consensus (RANSAC)**
to robustly fit various models such as planes, homographies and essential matrices.

* **Assignment 5**: In this assignment we will study **model fitting** using optimization. In particular we will compute the **maximal
likelihood** solution for a couple of structure and motion problems
